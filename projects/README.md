# Projects 
Going throught the curated content and tasks you learnt pytorch and computervision. Now is the time to do a project to validate your learning. Follow the following steps to get started with projects.

## Guidelines
### Idea selection
- The problem statement should be a computer vision task.
- You can collect dataset from the internet or collect your own dataset.

### Teaming up
- Teaming up is optional. If interested you can form teams talking to your fellow students.

### Idea presentation and working
Create a github repo for your project. In the README file add the following details
1. Project name
2. Brief description about the project
3. Info about the dataset (source, format, amount..etc)
4. Info about the model you are going to be used.


Update your details in this [teams form](https://bit.ly/TH_PyTorchProject). Mentor will evaluate your project and give necessary feedbacks.
